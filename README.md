# MNIST-Digit-Identifier

## Purpose
The purpsoe of this project is to learn about the varius machine learning models we can use to help us identify handwritten digits. 
This ranges from linear models such as one vs one, one vs rest classifiers to nonlinear models such as k-nearest neighbors and neural networks.
